# Projects repository of Francesco Serafini

This repository contains the code and documents I have produced in various context.

For now, there is 

1) a tutorial on how to implement Multinomial models using INLA

2) The code used to produce all the figures of a paper "Ranking earthquake forecasts using proper scoring rules: Binary events in a low probability environment
" than we are about to publish. The paper can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12065
