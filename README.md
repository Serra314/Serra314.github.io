# Projects repository of Francesco Serafini

This repository contains the code and documents I have produced in various context.

For now, there is 

1) Tutorial on how to implement Multinomial models using INLA

2) The code used to produce all the figures of a paper "Ranking earthquake forecasts using proper scoring rules: Binary events in a low probability environment
" than we are about to publish. The preprint version of the paper can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12065

3) Toy Example on how to approximate Hawkes Process models with Inlabru. It contains theory and code on : a) how to approximate general Point Process models with Inlabru (linear log intensity); b) discuss three approximation methods for Hawkes process models (non-linear log intensity);  c) compare the methods results visually and extend to the case where we consider priors.
